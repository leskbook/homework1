# Heriseon homework1

This project is meant to utilize html and css skills learned over the last 5 sessions. The goal of this exercise was to identify, fix and streamline the given code to match the provided representation https://leskbook.github.io/homework1/Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png/ 
Some of the challenges with this project came in the beginning, not knowing exactly where to start. I have made every attempt to recreate the supplied example but feel I am missing some elements of CSS streamling. 
I also didn't do enough commits. 
I believe all of this will come with time and practice.
